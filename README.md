# NUCLEO L432KC Bootloader and PIC Firmware Image research

This repository is for researching how to get STM32 NUCLEO-L432KC evaluation board to boot position independent firmware image code from an *arbitrary* location using custom bootloader. So to boot the same firmware blob from whatever location. (Of course the bootloader must know the address.)

Quick statuses

Bootloader: **Not implemented**

Firmware: **Not implemented**
